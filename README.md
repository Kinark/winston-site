This is the repo for the winston's website. It's currently in a very absurd state, it should be using styled-components and this README should include more info.

All that is temp because as of now the website doesn't have much influence on the app, so we're not fucusing on it atm.

Every commit in the branch `main` is currently being deployed by Vercel under the domains:
https://winston.lo.cafe
